#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com).

This project was split into two distinct parts: 1) Instanciation patterns: functional, functional-shared, prototypal, and pseudoclassical 2) Data structures: queue, stack, linked list, tree, binary search tree, graph, hash table.
